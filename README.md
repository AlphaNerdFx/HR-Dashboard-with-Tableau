# HR Dashboard: Summarized & Detailed

üîé Overview

The HR Dashboard Project is a comprehensive analytics solution designed to empower Human Resources managers with actionable insights derived from workforce data. Its main goal is to provide both a summary view for high-level strategic decisions and a detailed employee records view for operational analysis. This dual-layer design ensures that HR professionals can monitor overall organizational trends while also exploring individual employee information when needed.

The Summary View is organized into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis, each focusing on a different aspect of HR performance.

The Overview section provides a quick snapshot of key workforce metrics. It shows the total numbers of hired, active, and terminated employees, allowing managers to track workforce growth and attrition over time. Historical charts display hiring and termination trends by year to help identify recruitment patterns or turnover issues. This section also includes a breakdown of employees by department and job title, a comparison between headquarters (New York) and branch offices, and a geographic view showing employee distribution by city and state.

The Demographics section focuses on workforce composition and diversity. It highlights gender ratios, age group distributions, and education levels. Detailed visuals display the number of employees in each demographic group, helping HR teams assess balance and inclusivity. It also examines the relationship between education levels and performance ratings to uncover insights useful for hiring and training strategies.

The Income Analysis section explores compensation data to identify salary trends and disparities. It compares salaries across education levels for both genders to evaluate pay equity. It also analyzes how age correlates with salary across departments, providing insights into experience-based compensation patterns.

The Employee Records View complements the summary by offering a detailed, searchable, and filterable table of all employees, including their name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary. This enables HR managers to access specific records and perform deeper analysis.

Overall, the HR Dashboard serves as an intelligent decision-support system that enhances transparency, efficiency, and fairness while providing HR leaders with a data-driven foundation for strategic planning.

üìö Project Sources

- Project Data: The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.

- Icons & Images: The icons used in the HR Dashboard are sourced from Flaticon and customized using Photopea to match the dashboard‚Äôs color scheme. The PDS (Photopea files) can be found in the icon folder of the zip file for further editing if needed.

- Mockups: The initial dashboard mockup was created using the Procreate app on a tablet. Additionally, the dashboard container mockups were created using draw.io.

- Tableau Project File: The project file created during the course can be found in Zip file. You can also directly download the Tableau file from my Tableau Public Profile.
