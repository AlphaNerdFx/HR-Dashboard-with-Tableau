# HR Dashboard: Summarized & Detailed

🔎 Overview

The HR Dashboard Project is an analytics solution that helps HR managers gain insights from workforce data. It offers a summary view for strategic analysis and a detailed employee records view for operational needs.

The summary view is divided into three sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis. The Overview provides total counts of hired, active, and terminated employees, hiring and termination trends over time, and employee distribution by department, job title, city, and between headquarters in New York and other branches.

The Demographics section shows gender ratios, age and education distributions, and the relationship between education levels and performance ratings, helping HR teams evaluate diversity and talent quality.

The Income Analysis section compares salaries across education levels and genders to identify pay gaps and explores how age correlates with salary in different departments.

The Employee Records view presents a searchable and filterable table with details such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.

Overall, this dashboard supports informed decision-making, improves transparency, and strengthens workforce management through data-driven insights.

📚 Project Sources

- Project Data: The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.

- Icons & Images: The icons used in the HR Dashboard are sourced from Flaticon and customized using Photopea to match the dashboard’s color scheme. The PDS (Photopea files) can be found in the icon folder of the zip file for further editing if needed.

- Mockups: The initial dashboard mockup was created using the Procreate app on a tablet. Additionally, the dashboard container mockups were created using draw.io.

- Tableau Project File: The project file created during the course can be found in Zip file. You can also directly download the Tableau file from my Tableau Public Profile.
